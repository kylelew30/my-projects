## **Statistics Courses**


### STAT 365: Statistical Communication
##### **Project Description:** Analysis on how Religion is Changing in America. Used data provided from https://gss.norc.org/, tracking multiple religion related variables across multiple years to answer analytical questions. The focus for this project was my ability to effectively interpret and communicate my findings to a non-technical audience. 

##### **Skills Used:**
- Data Visualization
- Inferential Statistics
- Infographic Design

##### **Technologies Used:**
- Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint
- R

##### **Files:**
- [Report](Stats/Final_Report_365.pdf)
- [Infographic](Stats/Final_Infographic_365.pdf)

### STAT 421: Survey Sampling and Methodology
##### **Project Description:** With a class of 30 other students we worked with Cal Poly Student Affairs to conduct a research study on the state of their student employees. The survey focused on finding areas of improvement, specifically relating to onboarding, work environment, and career goals. At the end of the 10 week long project, we presented our findings to a group of Cal Poly faculty in the form of a PowerPoint presentation and a one page infographic. 

##### **Skills Used:**
- Survey Design
- Sampling Methods
- Data Visualization
- Infographic Design

##### **Technologies Used:**
- Microsoft Excel/PowerPoint
- Canva
- SAS
- R
- Campus Labs

##### **Files:**
- [Presentation](Stats/Final_Presentation_421.pdf)
- [Infographic](Stats/Final_Infographic_421.pdf)

## **Data Science Courses**

### DATA 301: Introduction to Data Science
##### **Project Description:** Analysis on how Data Science techniques can be used in Fantasy Basketball. I used a collection of common Data Science techniques to both predict and analyze NBA players in accordance to how well they would perform in Fantasy Basketball. 

##### **Skills Used:**
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Classification
- Predictive modeling
- Unsupervised learning(Clustering)

##### **Technologies Used:**
- Python
- scikit learn
- Jupyter Notebooks

##### **Files:**

### DATA 403: Data Science Projects Laboratory
##### **Project Description(Client A):** Worked with a 'simulated' Liquor store company to predict the amount of alcohol they would sell in the new year. With a small group of 4 students, we created built and tuned a predictive model on a large dataset with many predictors. Along with the code, the project consisted of a final report and presentation of our process and model performance. For this project we wrote all the model functions by hand without the use of prexisting Data Science packages(like scikit learn)

##### **Project Description(Client B):** Worked with a 'simulated' non-profit company to analyze drinking habits, specifically which factors most closely related to alcohol consumption. Along with the code, the project consisted of a final report and presentation of our process and findings. For this project we wrote all the model functions by hand without the use of prexisting Data Science packages(like scikit learn)

##### **Skills Used:**
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Model Tuning
- Gradient Descent
- Predictive modeling

##### **Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Microsoft Word/PowerPoint

##### **Files(Client A):**
- [Codebook](Data_Science/Final_Code_A_403.ipynb)
- [Report](Data_Science/Final_Report_A_403.pdf)
- [Presentation](Data_Science/Final_Presentation_A_403.pdf)

##### **Files(Client B):**
- [Codebook](Data_Science/Final_Code_B_403.ipynb)
- [Report](Data_Science/Final_Report_B_403.pdf)
- [Codebook](Data_Science/Final_Presentation_B_403.pdf)

## **Computer Science Courses**


### CSC 466: Knowledge Discovery From Data
##### **Project Description:** Using multiple common Data Analysis algorithms, we set out to dive into the state of mental and physical health in contemporary society, specifically looking to see which variables best predict certain health metrics. To do so we analyzed 3 seperate datasets, creating more specific analtical questions for each. Along with the code, the project consisted of a final report and presentation of our process and findings. For this project, we wrote all of the Data Analysis functions by hand, without the use of prexisting Data Science packages(like scikit learn)

##### **Skills Used:**
- KNN Classifier
- Clustering Analysis
- Frequent itemsets/Association rules
- Logistic Regression

##### **Technologies Used:**
- Microsoft Word
- Python

##### **Files:**
- [Report](CS/Final_Report_466.pdf)
- [Presentation](CS/Final_Presentation_466.pdf)
- [Codebook 1](CS/Final_Code1_466.ipynb)
- [Codebook 2](CS/Final_Code2_466.ipynb)
- [Codebook 3](CS/Final_Code3_466.ipynb)
